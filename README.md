●Object-oriented programming (OOP): The program is organized into classes, each representing a specific
aspect of the valet service (e.g. a vehicle, a car, a motorcycle, the garage). These classes contain attributes
and methods that represent the state and behavior of the valet service.

● Design and implementation accurately simulates the valet service, including adding and removing vehicles
from the garage, displaying the vehicles in the garage, charging the appropriate rate when a vehicle leaves,
and allowing overnight customers to request their car

● Data manipulation: The program involves manipulating data structures such as lists and dictionaries to store
and retrieve information about the state of the garage, including the number of spots available, the vehicles
currently in the garage, and the vehicle information for each vehicle.

● Utilizes custom exception classes and error checking to handle a full garage and other potential errors that
could occur during the valet service
