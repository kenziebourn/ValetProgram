# ValetProgram
The following Valet program uses OOP to create a basic application that allows companies to keep a database of vehicle information all in one place. The program allows the users to add and remove vehicles in the garage as well as assign them to parking spots. Daily rates are $10/hr while overnight rates are $45/hr (<24hrs). The program also differentiates between returning cars (overnight stays) and checked out cars which then charges the appropriate rate according to hours spent in the garage. Lastly, the client is able to get an audit on all of the vehicles currently in the garage via a CSV file. The file will be sorted alphabetically by name using the quicksort algorithm.

(After working in valet for almost a year now, the job has inspired my interest for creating this basic program which is incredibly useful for the hospitality industry. I also have a love for cars in general.)
